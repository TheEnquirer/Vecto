# Vecto
No more. I'm done. Time to make my own pdf viewer. 

## Idea

Super simple pdf viewer. Not for annotations. Just for viewing. 

### Features

- View the pdf
- Copy from the pdf


- Dark theme (invert colors?) 
- J/K scrolling
- Frameless window 
- Page number displayer 

And that's it! Begone, bloat!
