# Vecto
No more. I'm done. Time to make my own pdf viewer.

## Idea
Super simple pdf viewer. Not for annotations. Just for viewing.

### Features

- View the pdf : done

- Copy from the pdf : done

---

- Dark theme and Light theme : done

- Vim-like keybinds: 
  -  J/K scrolling : done
  -  H and L : done
  -  gg, G : done
  -  prefix : done
  -  prefix gg : WIP
  -  / : WIP

- Frameless window : done

- Page number displayer : done

- Open files 

- Multiple windows

And that's it! Begone, bloat!
